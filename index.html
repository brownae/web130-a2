            <h3>Rising Star Pastry Chef Sam Mason of OddFellows</h3>
            <p>Sam Mason is one of the most progressive culinary voices working in America today. A native of Jacksonville, Florida, Mason was educated at Johnson &amp; Wales University. After graduation, he completed a stage with Pierre Herm&eacute; at Ladur&eacute;e in Paris before moving to New York to make his mark.</p>

            <p>Mason honed his craft at some of the most prestigious kitchens in the country, including Palladin, Union Pacific, Atlas, and Park Avenue Caf&eacute;. During his tenure at wd~50, Mason was named a 2005 StarChefs New York Rising Star Pastry Chef and won national recognition for his hypermodern pastry. Mason is known for his amazing culinary vision and gift in combining unusual and innovative ingredients that surprise, delight, and challenge the palate.</p>

            <p>With Tailor, a contemporary dining and cocktail parlor, Mason&apos;s goal was to blur the line between dinner and dessert&mdash;testing the palates and the imaginations of his diners. His menu was divided into &ldquo;salty&rdquo; and &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; categories and featured unconventional takes on classic cocktails. Mason&rsquo;s other projects include IFC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dinner with the Band,&rdquo; featuring the renegade, punk rock best of modern music and cuisine. The recently opened Empire Mayonnaise marks Mason&rsquo;s first foray into the gourmet retail world. And in summer 2013, Mason returned to sweet flavors with the opening of OddFellows Ice Cream Co., in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>

            <h3>WSJ. Magazine Explores Will Goldfarb&rsquo;s Bali Restaurant</h3>
            <small>By <a href="http://nymag.com/author/Hugh%20Merwin/">Hugh Merwin</a></small>

            <p>In a WSJ. magazine profile, Howie Kahn provides a sort of postscript to one of the restaurant community&rsquo;s most enduringly enigmatic figures, that of pastry chef Will Goldfarb, who blazed a trail of culinary eccentricity and blatant quirk at places like Papillon and Room 4 Dessert around a decade back, before suddenly moving to Bali with his family in 2008. Goldfarb had already been planning to move, WSJ. reports, when he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his leg. Recovery, including radiation and surgery, took five months.</p>

            <p>After a unorthodox start in Indonesia, living with his wife and daughter in a bamboo building with no toilets or walls, Goldfarb &mdash; of whom Albert Adri&agrave; says, &ldquo;He has good hands but an even better mind&rdquo; &mdash; plotted the next phase of his career. He is now the chef at a &ldquo;tasting kitchen and laboratory&rdquo; called Mejekawi, a 24-seat, glass-walled establishment filled with cutting-edge equipment on the second floor of Ku De Ta, a local restaurant, where he turns out things like salak tarte Tatin, pandan leaf panna cotta, and kalamansi meringue with steamed milk cake. Goldfarb teaches pastry, conducts special dinners, and, fittingly, has all kinds of crazy-sounding plans for the techniques he&rsquo;s been working on.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;My resolve has always been strong in general,&rdquo; he tells Kahn, &ldquo;but now it&rsquo;s stratospheric. You go through trials by fire in kitchens, then you go through trials by fire in a hospital. I used to say it as a joke, but now you would literally have to kill me to derail what I want to do, which is to have the best restaurant, whatever that means. Maybe it&rsquo;s the best restaurant I can do. Maybe it&rsquo;s the best restaurant anyone can do.&rdquo;</p>

            <h3>Emmanuel Ryon</h3>
            <p>He is one of the most respected and refined ice cream masters in the world. 25 years of experience, World Pastry Champion in Lyon 1999 with France, and Meilleur Ouvrier de France Glacier 2000, are milestones of the life of a great professional. His work philosophy in formulation is well explained in his book, Apprenez l&rsquo;Art de la Glace et des Sorbets (2002), available only in French. The book details ice cream making from the traditional French perspective, with the ideal formulation to boost the ice creams&rsquo; flavors and textures to the max. Ice creams and sorbets, ice cream aperitifs, ice cream petit fours, nougats, plated desserts, savory ice creams, ice cream cups, among other creations, are found within the pages of this great book.</p>

            <p>His last adventure is the opening of the ice cream shop, Une Glace &agrave; Paris, in 2015, with which he returns to ice cream, his true passion. In collaboration with the pastry chef Olivier M&eacute;nard, this ice cream shop recreates great classics of pastry and ice cream through an ornamental aesthetic, inspired by the past and with a very personal vision of the flavor influenced by travel. In his creations, Ryon proposes attractive sets of textures, which take the customer to a new level in the tasting of ice cream, with creations that reinterpret the past with the mastery of one of the most refined and versatile professionals.</p>

            <p>Beyond ice cream making, his versatility in other disciplines such as pastry and plated desserts is also well-known, a virtue that has deepened in his time in Caf&eacute; Pouchkine and in the creative development of the desserts of the restaurants of the prestigious chef, Anne-Sophie Pic.</p>
